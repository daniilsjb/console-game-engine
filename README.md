# ConsoleGameEngine

Game Engine framework created entirely within Windows Console API. This project is my own version of javidx9's `olcConsoleGameEngine.h`, [which may be found here](https://github.com/OneLoneCoder/videos/blob/master/olcConsoleGameEngine.h), written from scratch with various modifications and improvements. Rather importantly, this version of CGE is not compatible with olcCGE.

Credits to javidx9!
